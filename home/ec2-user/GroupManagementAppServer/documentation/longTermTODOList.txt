Long term TODO list:
- maximize scalability of code
	> Make parent-selection (namely a button somewhere in a <tr> element be able to select, and do something with that <tr> element it is in) scalable. HTML coder should be able to nest all they want, and your selection should 
		still work.
		> Look into .parents("someFilterHere") .
- modify password field in #employeeTable
	> if entry was freshly entered, password shows
	> otherwise, there should exist no entry for it
- modify logic of inventoryTable modifier so that, new items,containers,locations get written to database if they are not found in the HTML table (after user agrees to it)
- make the auto-complete in Inventory form pull from database instead of from #inventoryTable
- implement "Report Items" feature
	> implement e-mail system for notifying person to re-count items
- clone project into other folder
	> other folder should be folder for implementing this into your for-real application
- have server-side code modify default value of `group_member`.`GroupMemberGradYear` on a certain day
	> day: first day admin, or other user, uses this service
- make any AJAX requests that elements of the page make to the server have global attribute set to false
