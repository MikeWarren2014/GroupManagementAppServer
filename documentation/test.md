### functionA()

Some text. 

### functionB()

Some really long filler paragraph that is only here to force the page to not have enough room for all the sections. This way, one can test to see if the links really work. If they don't it means, more than likely, that the non-alphabetic characters are going to have to be hard-coded. In the markdown-page-generating project you're working on, it means that you're going to have to convert the `char`s `'()'`, `')'` to string representation of the URL version of the ASCII code for them. You shouldn't have to manually look that up, because, in C++, a `char` is really a type of `int`. Thus, it should likely be some stringstream stuff. If push comes to shove, you would have to write the logic to generate the hexadecimal ASCII code, which, in that case, you should probably actually look up the ASCII codes. 

### functionC()

Damn, this project is taking too much time to work on by just myself. Even worse is the fact that I am naturally hesitant to even make a move on it, and I am, dare I reveal it, a bit lazy on my own. I also am in bad need of a job. Speaking of which, IK have plan for a JavaScript that auto-populates any online job employment history section with all my job experience. Oops, I hope nobody's looking at this right now.

### functionD()

Another section.
