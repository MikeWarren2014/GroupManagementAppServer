# GroupManagementAppServer

For lack of a better name. (This is work in progress.)

The default name of this project is pretty much self-explanatory: this is a service for managing groups. This service is intended to be a modular group/inventory management service. (I would have named it GroupInventoryManagementAppServer , but that is more of a motuhfulthan the currrent name.) It is attempt to facilitate real-time updating of inventory records (such as at an event, when resources inventory resources are being handed out during an event, or when an item gets removed from storage).

### Fully customizable group and inventory management

This product brings together group management and inventory management. Though incomplete, this allows users to add, remove, update, and report inventory items. Thus far, the following features have been implemented, to some extent: 
*	View/edit Members
*	Member availability
*	Add/edit inventory
* View/modify reported items
*	Inventory history
*	External pages

Admins can create and customize user types and user roles. By default, there exist two: basic user and admin. Basic user only has view privileges on all the tabs, and admin has edit privileges on all the tabs.
